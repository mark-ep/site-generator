###### Heading Six

here's a load of text to see what it looks like. **some text is bold**, _some is italic_, and some of the
text is `code-formatted`. If I want to create a block of code it might look like this:

    #!python
    # this is a comment

    def fibonnaci(n):
        """the fibonnaci function"""
        if n <= 2:
            return 1
        return fibonnaci(n-1) + fibonnaci(n-2)

here's some more text again.
